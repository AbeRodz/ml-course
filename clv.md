# CLV 

CLV is heavily based on a concept from marketing called RFM classification

**R**

Recency: date of customer's last transaction

**F**

Frecuency: frequency of customer buys from within a period of time.

**M**

Monetary Value: average value of transactions in a period of time.


## ("buy till you die") Pareto/NBD model (schmittlein, morrison)

### Transaction Process 
- While active a customer purchases randomly around his mean transaction rate

- Transaction rates are unique for every customer

### Dropout Process
- Each customer has an unobserved dropout propensity
- Dropout propensities vary accross customers
